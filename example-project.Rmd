## Introduction

I'll add stuff here soon.

## Task 1

This code creates a data frame called “dist”. The dist data frame contains measurements for 202 light bulbs 2104 hours after the light bulb was turned on.

```{r}
library(data4led)
dist <- led_time(2100)
dist
```

Let's create a histogram to see what the intensities look like after 2104 hours.

```{r}
hist(dist$percent_intensity)
```

Almost every bulb (maybe 3 don't) have an intensity above 100 percent.
